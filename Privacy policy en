Data collected via the SDKs is transferred to and processed by third parties—specifically, Yandex LLC (and its affiliates, which may be located outside the European Union)—acting as independent Data Controllers or Data Processors. This transfer is necessary for the functionality of the analytics and advertising services.
5.3. By using the Application, the User acknowledges that their anonymized data may be transferred to and stored on servers located in countries outside the European Economic Area (EEA), including the Russian Federation. Such transfers are conducted on the basis of adequacy decisions (where applicable) or standard contractual clauses adopted by the European Commission, as implemented by the third-party service providers.
